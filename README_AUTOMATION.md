# Viptela Automation Workshop

This is the network automation version of the [Viptela SDX Workshop](README.md).  It is not meant to be an exhaustive treatment
of any of the technologies presented, but an application of those technologies to a real-world use case for automation.  In order
to get the most from this workshop, we recommend these [pre-requisites](devnet_courses.md) from [Cisco DevNet](https://developer.cisco.com/).
